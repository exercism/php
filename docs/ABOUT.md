PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language. Php provides benefits like :- 
* Reducing server traffic by validating user input in the browser before it is sent to the server.
* Providing immediate feedback to the site visitors so that they don't have to reload pages just to get error messages on form validations.
* Allowing richer user interfaces with content changes on mouse hover, drag and drop gestures, and animations.

Client-side Php is interpreted in the browser without requiring compilation. This allows interactive content to be included in HTML pages which would otherwise be static.

Server-Side Php as run in NodeJS enables back-end access to databases, file systems, and servers. NodeJS is built on Google Chrome's Php V8 Engine. NodeJS uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node can be a great solution for applications requiring I/O bound operations, data streaming etc. More details can be found  [here](https://nodejs.org/en/about/)
