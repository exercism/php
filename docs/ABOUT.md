#Introduction
PHP is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML.

Fast, flexible and pragmatic, PHP powers everything from your blog to the most popular websites in the world.

What distinguishes PHP from something like client-side JavaScript is that the code is executed on the server, generating HTML which is then sent to the client. 
 
PHP is extremely simple for a newcomer, but offers many advanced features for a professional programmer.

##What can PHP do?
Anything. PHP is mainly focused on server-side scripting, so you can do anything any other CGI program can do, such as collect form data, generate dynamic page content, or send and receive cookies. But PHP can do much more.
