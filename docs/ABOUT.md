# PHP

PHP is a development language intended for the web that has become popular because it is easy to learn, over time it has become a modern language and so won its space in the roll of the most respected programming languages. To get started with PHP is very simple! just add some PHP -tags to an already existing HTML file and voila!

PHP is also a language that has broad community support (since 1995) with a big user base, and a clear and simple documentation.
