PHP is a widely-used open source scripting language. It is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML.

Fast, flexible and pragmatic, PHP powers everything from simple websites to popular sites such as Facebook, Wikipedia, and Wordpress.
 
##What can PHP do?
PHP is mainly focused on server-side scripting. You can do anything any other CGI program can do, such as collect form data, generate dynamic page content, or send and receive cookies. But PHP can do much more.
* Embed dynamic content [directly into HTML pages.](http://php.net/manual/en/language.basic-syntax.phpmode.php)
* Support a [wide range of databases.](http://php.net/manual/en/refs.database.php)
* Use [object oriented programming.](http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.php)

PHP has excellent documentation and more information can be found  [here](http://php.net/)

##Why should you learn PHP?
PHP is easy to get started with but also has advanced language features you will use as you grow as a developer.
* [In one survey](http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/programming_language/all) PHP is used by over 80% of websites where the server-side language is known. 
* There is and will be a strong demand for PHP programmers now and in the future.
