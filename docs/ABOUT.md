# PHP

PHP is a development language intended for the web that has become popular because it is easy to learn, over time it has become a modern language and so won its space in the roll of the most respected programming languages. It was originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994 to manager your personal blog. To get started with PHP is very simple! just add some PHP -tags to an already existing HTML file and voila!

PHP is also a language that has broad community support (since 1995) with a big user base, and a clear and simple documentation.
