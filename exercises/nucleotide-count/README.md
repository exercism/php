# Nucleotide Count

Given a DNA string, compute how many times each nucleotide occurs in the string.

DNA is represented by an alphabet of the following symbols: 'A', 'C',
'G', and 'T'.

Each symbol represents a nucleotide, which is a fancy name for the
particular molecules that happen to make up a large part of DNA.

Shortest intro to biochemistry EVAR:

- twigs are to birds nests as
- nucleotides are to DNA and RNA as
- amino acids are to proteins as
- sugar is to starch as
- oh crap lipids

I'm not going to talk about lipids because they're crazy complex.

So back to nucleotides.

DNA contains four types of them: adenine (`A`), cytosine (`C`), guanine
(`G`), and thymine (`T`).

RNA contains a slightly different set of nucleotides, but we don't care
about that for now.

## Making the Test Suite Pass

1. Get [PHPUnit].

        % wget --no-check-certificate https://phar.phpunit.de/phpunit.phar
        % chmod +x phpunit.phar

2. Execute the tests for an assignment.

        % phpunit.phar wordy/wordy_test.php
