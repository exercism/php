# Nucleotide Count

Given a single stranded DNA string, compute how many times each nucleotide occurs in the string.

The genetic language of every living thing on the planet is DNA.
DNA is a large molecule that is built from an extremely long sequence of individual elements called nucleotides.
4 types exist in DNA and these differ only slightly and can be represented as the following symbols: 'A' for adenine, 'C' for cytosine, 'G' for guanine, and 'T' thymine.

Here is an analogy:
- twigs are to birds nests as
- nucleotides are to DNA as
- legos are to lego houses as
- words are to sentences as...


## Running the tests

1. Go to the root of your PHP exercise directory, which is `<EXERCISM_WORKSPACE>/php`.
   To find the Exercism workspace run

        % exercism debug | grep Workspace

1. Get [PHPUnit] if you don't have it already.

        % wget --no-check-certificate https://phar.phpunit.de/phpunit.phar
        % chmod +x phpunit.phar

2. Execute the tests:

        % ./phpunit.phar nucleotide-count/nucleotide-count_test.php
