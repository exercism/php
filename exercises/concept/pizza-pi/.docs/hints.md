# Hints

## General

- It might be useful to have a list of all of the [arithmetic operations][arithmetic-operations] in PHP.

## 1. A Dough Ratio

- This task uses basic arithmetic with addition and multiplication.

## 2. A Splash of Sauce

- To ensure a whole number of cans, you'll need to round up. PHP provides [numeric functions][numeric-functions] that can help.

## 3. Some Cheese, Please

- You can cube a number using the [exponentiation operator][arithmetic-operations].
- You’ll need to round the result down; PHP has a [numeric function][numeric-functions] for that.
- PHP also provides a [built-in function][pi-function] for pi (π) 

## 4. A Fair Share

- Use the [modulo operator][arithmetic-operations] (`%`) to get the remainder after division.
