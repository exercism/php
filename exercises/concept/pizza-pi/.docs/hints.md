# Hints

## General

- It might be useful to have a list of all of the [arithmetic operations][arithmetic-operations] in PHP.

## 1. A Dough Ratio

- PHP has [a built-in constant][pi-constant] for pi (Ï€) 
- When it comes to rounding, PHP provides [numeric functions][numeric-functions]

## 2. A Splash of Sauce

- When rounding up, PHP provides a [numeric function][numeric-functions].

## 3. Some Cheese, Please

- For cubing a number, there is a [built-in exponentiation function][arithmetic-operations].

## 4. A Fair Share

- This part requires using a function you may not have come across before, the [modulo
function][arithmetic-operations] (`%`).
  This function gives you the remainder of the division between two numbers.
