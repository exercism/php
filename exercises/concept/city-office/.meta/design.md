# Design

This exercise should provide a boilerplate with already implemented functions that only need a type declaration.
The functions should be simple so that the exercise can appear early in the concept tree.

## Learning objectives

- property types
- method parameter types
- method return types

## Out of scope

- type unions
- phpstan/psalm types

## Prerequisites

- `integers`
- `floating-point-numbers`
- `strings`
- `booleans`
- `arrays`
- `class-basics`

## Concepts

- `type-declarations`
