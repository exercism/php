# Design

This exercise should use type declarations.
It focuses on coercion and casting of `int` and `string` values.
The functions should be simple so that the exercise can appear early in the concept tree.

## Learning objectives

- Understanding coersion to `int` from `string` and vice versa
- Understanding that casting does not change the rules for the conversion

## Out of scope

- `array`, `bool`, `float`, `enum` and `object` coersion / casting
- Union type coersion / casting
- Strict types

## Prerequisites

- `arithmetic-operators`
- `arrays`
- `integers`
- `strings`
- `type-declaration`

## Concepts

- `type-juggling`
