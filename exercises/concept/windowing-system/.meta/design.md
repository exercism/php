# Design

## Learning objectives

- Reference to OOP
- PHP is a multi-paradign general purpose language with OOP features, what does that mean?
- How to use a constructor function 
- What does `$this` mean/do
- How to create a new instance with `new`

## Out of Scope

The following topics will be introduced later and should therefore not be part of this concept exercise.

- inheritance between classes (`extends`, `super`)
- `instanceof` (introduced in the inheritance concept)

## Concepts

The Concept this exercise unlocks is:

- `class-basics`

## Prerequisites

- `funtions` as they are the basis for classes and are needed in the exercise
- `integers` as they are the basis for the properties underlying type

## Analyzer

- TBD

## Notes

The exercise is ported from [Windowing System Exercise in the JavaScript track][js-windowing-system].
Tasks were omitted to allow exercise to appear earlier in the tree since they are used heavily in many PHP paradigms.
