## Running the tests

1. Go to the root of your PHP exercise directory, which is `<EXERCISM_WORKSPACE>/php`.
   To find the Exercism workspace run

   ```shell
   exercism workspace
   ```

2. Install [PHPUnit] if you don't have it already.
3. Execute the tests with:

   ```shell
   phpunit test_file.php
   ```

   For example, to run the tests for the Hello World exercise, you would run:

   ```shell
   phpunit HelloWorldTest.php
   ```
