# Bob

Bob is a lackadaisical teenager. In conversation, his responses are very limited.

Bob answers 'Sure.' if you ask him a question.

He answers 'Whoa, chill out!' if you yell at him.

He says 'Fine. Be that way!' if you address him without actually saying
anything.

He answers 'Whatever.' to anything else.

The commented tests at the bottom of the bob_test.php are **Stretch Goals**, they are optional. They may be easier to
 solve if you are using the `mb_string` functions, which aren't installed by default with every version of PHP.

## Making the Test Suite Pass

1. Get [PHPUnit].

        % wget --no-check-certificate https://phar.phpunit.de/phpunit.phar
        % chmod +x phpunit.phar

2. Execute the tests for an assignment.

        % phpunit.phar wordy/wordy_test.php
