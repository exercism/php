# About

In PHP, variables always start with a dollar sign (`$`). The name of a variable is case sensitive. It must start with an underscore (`_`) or a letter (`a-z` or `A-Z`), followed by any number of letters, underscores, or numbers.

```php
$variable = "Hello World!";
```

Variables may represent any type of value, and they may be reassigned to different types.

```php
$my_var = 1;
$my_var = "Now I am assigned a string!";
```
