 * One line in comments

 * - Please use `assertSame()` whenever possible. Add a comment with reason
 *   when it is not possible.
 * - Do not use calls with named arguments. Use them only when the
 *   exercise requires named arguments (e.g. because the exercise is
 *   about named arguments).
 *   Named arguments are in the way of defining argument names the
 *   students want (e.g. in their native language).
 * - Add `@testdox` with a useful test title, e.g. the test case heading
 *   from canonical data. The online editor shows that to students.
 * - Add fail messages to assertions where helpful to tell students more
 *   than `@testdox` says.
